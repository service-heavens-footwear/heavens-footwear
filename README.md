Hello, I am Carmen Chu, one of the members of Heaven's Footwear Inc. and the creator of it's website: heavensfootwear.ml 
<br>
I created this website beacause we needed a print ad for our product, and I thought, "Why not do a website?"
<br>
I am 13 yrs old and in Grade 7. I started coding in Grade 5 and have since then become fluent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
<br>
This website was made with the help of Github Pages, Cloudflare, Freenom, W3Schools, and a certain Chung brother. (*cough cough thx Nathan*)
