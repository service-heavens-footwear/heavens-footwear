                <h3>About The Product</h3>
                    <p><em>Detachable Shoe Souls</em> are shoes with detachable soles. The soles come in a variety of 
                    types, like hiking shoe soles, running shoe soles, training shoe soles, soccer 
                    cleat soles, baseball cleat soles, and more, making them extremely versatile. We designed this product for all ages and they are also unisex. If you are an athlete or a traveller, these shoes are 
                    a must-have.</p>

                        var i;
                        var x = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
                        if (n > x.length) {slideIndex = 1} 
                        if (n < 1) {slideIndex = x.length} ;

                </div>
                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                        <p><em>Detachable Shoe Souls</em> are designed with zippers attaching the sole and body. Each sole can be easily unzipped, taken out and replaced, or zipped with the body. For example, if you have baseball practice right after track and field, you only need to bring <strong>one</strong> pair of shoes, plus a pair of soles. Much more portable than <strong>two</strong> pairs of shoes!</p>
